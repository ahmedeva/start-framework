## Questions | IMPORTANT: 📝

1. How to make the navbar expand and shrink/minimize on scroll? I could have used intersection observer API instead of the window scroll for better performance -- scroll fires every time it is used ❌. However, I needed a more Angular-way to implement it... How can we go about it?
2. How to disable the "green-ish" navbar links on smaller devices when the navigation collapses? It is easire to do it with CSS, but we are using routerLinkActive, so...
3. The carousel in the Portfolio section is not implemented.

Moreover, Imma send you a video for all the questions that were asked here.

Thanks in advance! ❤️‍🔥
